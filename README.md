# Why?

This is a set of tools, scripts and instructions to convert the default World of Warcraft in-game icons that have had different look over the years and expansions to a more uniform look.

This project is a continuation of suicidalkatt's [Clean Icons](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info17774-CleanIcons-Square.html).
